The original seismic single-channel record dataset is located in the "Data" folder. The ResNet network structure program is in the "net" folder. 

"GAF transform.py" is used to convert the seismic single-channel record data into GAF images. 

"Data_split.py" is used to split the dataset.

 "Train.py" is used to train the network model.  

"Confusionmatrix.py" is used to test the classification performance using the trained model and generate the confusion matrix. 

The final output results (including accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix) are stored in the "Accuracy and loss" and "Confusionmatrix" folders, respectively.
